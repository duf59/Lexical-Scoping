# We define here two functions which, when used together, enable to cache
# matrix inversion computation (potentially time-consuming).
#
# The functions should be used as follow :
#
#   - First create a special so-called "matrix"-object with makeCacheMatrix().
#     The latter takes a matrix as argument and returns a "matrix"-object
#     that stores the input matrix value and caches its inverse.
#
#   - Then, to compute the inverse of the matrix, use the cacheSolve() function. 
#     It takes as argument a "matrix"-object created with makeCacheMatrix().
#     It checks if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the
#     inverse from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates
#     the inverse and sets the value in the cache.
#
# Important note : the setInverse() function return by makeCacheMatrix(), which
#                  is part of the "matrix"-object, should not be called directly
#                  (this will corrupt the functioning of the code).
#                  It is only intended to be called by cacheSolve() function.

  #     -- setInverse():  set the value of the inverse matrix,
